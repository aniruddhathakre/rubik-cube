# Rubik's Cube Solver 🧩

This is a simple Rubik's Cube visualizer and solver built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can scramble the cube, solve it step-by-step, or even rotate individual faces manually using the buttons. It’s a fun little tool to learn how the cube works and watch the solving process in action!

## Features

- 🧠 Scramble the cube with random moves
- 🔁 Solve it step-by-step (based on the scramble)
- 🎮 Manually rotate cube faces
- 📦 Fully client-side – no libraries or APIs used
- 🌐 Works directly in the browser

## How to Use

1. **Scramble** the cube using the "Scramble" button.
2. Watch the cube mix up!
3. Click **"Solve"** to reverse the scramble step-by-step.
4. You can also make **manual moves** using the buttons below.

This was made as part of a learning project/internship to explore basic web development and JavaScript logic. 😊
